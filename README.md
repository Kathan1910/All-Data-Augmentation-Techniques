# Data Augmentation Techniques

This repository contains notebooks demonstrating different data augmentation techniques for improving the performance of machine learning models. Each notebook focuses on a specific data augmentation method and provides usage instructions, advantages, disadvantages, and other important details.

## ImgAug - Advanced Data Augmentation

### Description
ImgAug is a powerful image augmentation library that offers a wide range of techniques for enhancing your dataset. From geometric transformations to color manipulations, ImgAug provides flexibility and customization for your augmentation needs.

### Usage
1. Install the ImgAug library using `pip install imgaug`.
2. Follow the examples in the `Data Augmentation Using ImgAug.ipynb` notebook to apply advanced augmentations.
3. Experiment with different augmentation techniques, parameters, and sequences to find the best configuration for your dataset.

### Advantages
- Extensive set of augmentation techniques.
- Highly customizable for specific use cases.
- Supports augmenting images with different sizes.

### Disadvantages
- Learning curve due to the numerous augmentation options.
- May require fine-tuning for optimal results.

## OpenCV - Basic Image Augmentation

### Description
OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that also provides basic image augmentation capabilities. It's well-suited for simple data augmentation tasks, such as rotation, flipping, and scaling.

### Usage
1. Install OpenCV using `pip install opencv-python`.
2. Refer to the `Data Augmentation Using OpenCV.ipynb` notebook for basic augmentation techniques.
3. Implement OpenCV-based augmentations for your dataset by following the provided examples.

### Advantages
- Simple and efficient augmentation methods.
- Fast execution, suitable for large datasets.
- Good for basic geometric transformations.

### Disadvantages
- Limited compared to more advanced libraries like ImgAug.
- Less flexibility for complex augmentations.

## SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

### Description
SMOTE is a technique designed to address class imbalance problems in datasets. It synthesizes new minority class samples to balance class distributions, which can improve model performance on imbalanced datasets.

### Usage
1. Install the `imbalanced-learn` library using `pip install imbalanced-learn`.
2. Refer to the `Data Augmentation Using SMOTE.ipynb` notebook to learn how to use SMOTE for class balancing.
3. Apply SMOTE-based augmentation to your imbalanced dataset by following the notebook instructions.

### Advantages
- Effectively addresses class imbalance problems.
- Helps prevent bias towards the majority class.
- Can be used with various machine learning algorithms.

### Disadvantages
- May generate synthetic samples that are less representative of the true data distribution.
- Careful handling of class weights and evaluation metrics is required.

## Combining Techniques

### Description
The `Data Augmentation Combined.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the power of combining multiple data augmentation techniques. By using ImgAug, OpenCV, and SMOTE together, you can create a robust augmentation pipeline that addresses class imbalance and enhances data diversity.

### Usage
1. Explore the combined augmentation notebook to see how to integrate ImgAug, OpenCV, and SMOTE.
2. Customize the combination to suit your specific dataset and problem.

### Advantages
- Improved model generalization through a combination of techniques.
- Enhanced class balance and data diversity.
- Potential for significant performance gains.

### Disadvantages
- Increased complexity and longer training times.
- Requires careful configuration and parameter tuning.
